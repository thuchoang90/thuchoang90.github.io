### Core Knowledge

Learn how to modify a RISC-V computer system for **security purposes**.
<br>
<ins>Examples</ins>: cryptographic accelerators, secure boot, side-channel attacks, *etc*.

### Course Requirement

Participants <ins>must</ins> have studied courses <a href="../../../../teaching/2022/12/30/RISC-V-Integration">01: RISC-V Computer System Integration</a>,
<br>
<a href="../../../../teaching/2022/12/30/RISC-V-CHISEL">02: Hardware Design with CHISEL</a>,
<br>
and <a href="../../../../teaching/2022/12/30/RISC-V-Linux">03: Linux on RISC-V</a>.

Exercises in this course use the <a href="https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/start">Arty-A7</a> FPGA board. Participants need to have an Arty-A7 to learn this course.
<br>
*Note:* both 35T and 100T versions of the FPGA are ok.
