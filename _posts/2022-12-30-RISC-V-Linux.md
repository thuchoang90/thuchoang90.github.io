### Core Knowledge

Learn how to make a **Linux** image and **boot** your RISC-V computer system.
<br>
Then, learn to **control** your <ins>custom hardware</ins> in **User mode** after boot.

### Course Requirement

Participants <ins>must</ins> have studied the course <a href="./teaching/2022/12/30/RISC-V-Integration">01: RISC-V Computer System Integration</a>.
<br>
Participants <ins>don't need</ins> to know the **Scala-CHISEL** language to learn this course.

Exercises in this course use the Arty-A7 FPGA board. Participants need to have an Arty-A7 to learn this course.
<br>
*Note:* both 35T and 100T versions of the FPGA are ok.
