### Core Knowledge

Learn how to design a **simple processor** with the *RISC-V ISA*.
<br>
Learn various design techniques used in <ins>modern processors</ins>, such as out-of-order and cache systems.

### Course Requirement

Participants <ins>must</ins> have **digital design** knowledge and know how to use **Verilog** *(or VHDL)* language.
<br>
Participants <ins>must</ins> be familiar with **FPGA** work.

Exercises in this course use the <a href="https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/start">Arty-A7</a> FPGA board. Participants need to have an Arty-A7 to learn this course.
<br>
*Note:* both 35T and 100T versions of the FPGA are ok.
