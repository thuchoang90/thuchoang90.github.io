### Core Knowledge

Learn how to add your **custom hardware** *(written in Verilog or VHDL)* to an existing RISC-V computer system.
<br>
Learn how to control and debug your custom hardware in <ins>software</ins> after regenerating the system.

### Course Requirement

Participants <ins>must</ins> have **digital design** knowledge and know how to use **Verilog** *(or VHDL)* language.
<br>
Participants <ins>don't need</ins> to know the **Scala-CHISEL** language to learn this course.

Exercises in this course use the <a href="https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/start">Arty-A7</a> FPGA board. Participants need to have an Arty-A7 to learn this course.
<br>
*Note:* both 35T and 100T versions of the FPGA are ok.
